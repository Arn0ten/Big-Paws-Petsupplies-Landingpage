Welcome to **Big Paws Petsupplies**! Our pet hotel offers premium boarding, daycare, and pet care services for all your furry friends. This system aims to streamline communication, organize pet care information, and provide a better experience for both our staff and pet owners.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Big Paws Petsupplies is transforming how we communicate and manage pets at our hotel. From automated update requests to a professional customer portal, we are building a system that will help us stay organized, efficient, and keep our pet owners happy.

### 🔧 Challenges We Solve

- **Unorganized Communication**: Pet update requests were previously handled via Messenger, leading to missed or delayed responses.
- **Scattered Pet Information**: Feeding schedules, health notes, and special instructions were difficult to track.
- **No Request Tracking**: There was no system to prioritize or log pet care updates.
- **Unprofessional Image**: The business relied on informal channels, making operations appear unstructured.

## 🛠️ Features

- **🎥 Centralized Update Requests**: Pet owners can request updates (photos/videos) and receive timely responses directly from the system.
- **📚 Organized Pet Profiles**: Securely store all pet details (feeding schedules, health notes, special instructions) for easy access.
- **⏳ Request Tracking**: Log and prioritize update requests to ensure no request is overlooked.
- **💻 Customer Portal**: A web-based interface where pet owners can manage their pets' stay, view updates, and communicate with staff.
- **📊 Reporting & Analytics**: Track pet stays, service utilization, and revenue in real time.
- **✉️ Automated Notifications**: Owners receive alerts for updates, approvals, and status changes.
- **💎 Secure Payment Processing**: Handle transactions for boarding, grooming, and additional services.

## 📈 Project Objectives

- **100% of update requests** will be logged in the system within 2 months.
- **95% of pet profiles** will be digitized and stored within 1 month.
- **90% reduction in manual tracking** of requests within 3 months.
- **90% adoption rate** of the customer portal within 4 months.
- **95% of update requests** will be responded to within 24 hours.
- **99% system uptime** to ensure availability for staff and pet owners.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS (For the customer portal)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (For request handling & admin dashboard)
- **Database**: MongoDB (For secure pet profile and transaction storage)
- **Notifications**: Email & Push Notifications (For update requests)
